                <p>Welcome to my personal study website! This is the Home page, the starting point of my journey into
                    web
                    development. I created this space to practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and to document everything
                    I
                    learn along the way. Whether you're a fellow student, a curious visitor, or just passing by, I hope
                    you
                    find something interesting here. This site is constantly evolving as I experiment with new layouts,
                    styles, and features. I believe that learning by doing is the best way to grow, so every part of
                    this
                    site reflects my progress. Feel free to explore the other sections, check out my blog posts, learn
                    more
                    about me, or get in touch. Thanks for visiting, and welcome to my coding worldhonest way, focusing
